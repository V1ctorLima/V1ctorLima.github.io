# Tips for Maintaining Your Jekyll Blog

Maintaining a Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages is straightforward once you understand the basics. This post provides some practical tips to help you manage your blog efficiently and keep it running smoothly.

## Writing New Posts

Creating new content for your Jekyll blog is as simple as adding Markdown files to the `_posts` directory. Here are some tips for writing effective posts:

### Naming Convention

Always name your post files following this format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post.md
```

For example: `2023-09-01-maintaining-your-jekyll-blog.md`

### Front Matter

Every post should begin with YAML front matter enclosed between triple-dashed lines:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT
categories: [category1, category2]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

### Markdown Formatting

Jekyll uses Markdown for content formatting. Here are some common formatting options:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

[Link text](URL)

![Image alt text](image-url)

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

1. Numbered item 1
2. Numbered item 2

> Blockquote text

`Inline code`

```language
Code block
```
```

## Adding Images

To add images to your posts:

1. Place your images in the `assets/img/posts/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Reference them in your posts using Markdown:

```markdown
![Image description](/assets/img/posts/your-image-name.jpg)
```

For better organization, consider creating subdirectories for each post:

```
assets/img/posts/2023-09-01-post-title/image1.jpg
```

## Local Development

Before pushing changes to GitHub, it's a good idea to preview your site locally:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your blog directory
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000`

This allows you to catch any formatting issues or errors before they go live.

## Customizing Your Theme

The Chirpy theme offers several customization options:

### Site Configuration

Edit `_config.yml` to change site-wide settings like:
- Site title and description
- Social media links
- Avatar image
- Theme preferences

### Custom CSS

To add custom styles:
1. Edit the `assets/css/custom.scss` file
2. Add your custom CSS rules
3. Jekyll will automatically compile and include these styles

## SEO Optimization

Jekyll makes it easy to optimize your blog for search engines:

1. **Use descriptive titles**: Each post should have a clear, descriptive title
2. **Add meta descriptions**: Include a description in your front matter
3. **Use categories and tags**: Properly categorize and tag your content
4. **Internal linking**: Link to your other relevant posts when appropriate
5. **Image alt text**: Always include descriptive alt text for images

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

If your GitHub Pages build fails:
1. Check the GitHub Actions log for error messages
2. Verify your front matter syntax (common source of errors)
3. Ensure all links and image paths are correct

### Missing Content

If posts aren't appearing:
1. Check the file naming convention
2. Verify the date in the front matter isn't in the future
3. Ensure the front matter is properly formatted

## Conclusion

Maintaining a Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages gives you the perfect balance of simplicity and control. By following these tips, you can focus on creating great content while ensuring your blog remains well-organized and easy to maintain.

Remember that the beauty of Jekyll is its simplicityâ€”you can start with the basics and gradually explore more advanced features as you become more comfortable with the platform.

Happy blogging!
